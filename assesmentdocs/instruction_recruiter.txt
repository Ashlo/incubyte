Thanks for your interest in our Data Engineer position. We're looking for ETL experts - who take pride in the way they code and are passionate about using clean coding practices. You must also want to work on migrating packages to Python. Experience working with Azure is a huge plus.

As the next step in our assessment process, please take the technical assessment mentioned here: https://incubytein-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/lifi_incubyte_co/ETMuapYYTJJLsBOLWPl_G0EBTWGJkeYfkoilcHt-Nye7Sg?e=j6l4Ty
Please code the solution in Python using Pandas, Numpy modules using clean coding practices and if possible using TDD, and please send us the Git link for review. If you havenâ€™t gone through the videos and blogs on our website yet, I strongly encourage you take some time to do so before you take the assessment.

 Simply to get better familiarized with the processes we follow and coding practices we believe in. These are the kind of things we will look for while evaluating your solution, in addition (of course!) to the logical thinking and step by step analysis of the problem.
