I own a Multi-Specialty Hospital chain with locations all across the world. My hospital is famous for
Vaccination. Patients who come to my hospital (across the globe) will be given a User Card with
which they can access any of my hospital in the world.
Current Status:
We maintain all customers in one database. There are heaps of customers with user cards to my
hospital. So, I decided to split up the customers based on the country and load them into
corresponding country tables.
To pull the customers as per Country, my developers should know what are all the places the
Customer Data is available. So, the data extracting will be done by our Source System. They will pull
the all the relevant customer data and will give us a Data file.
In design documents, you will have:
◦ File Name Specification – Name String, Extension of the files
◦ Date and Time format of the File – YYYYMMDD, HHMMSSTT or any other format
◦ Header Records Layout –
|H|Customer_Name|Customer_Id|Open_Date|Last_Consulted_Date|Vaccination_Id|Dr_Name|State|Count
ry|DOB|Is_Active
◦ Details Record Layout – |D|John|123456|20101012|20121013|MVD|Paul|NSW|AU|06031987|A
Detail Records will tell you what data you are getting from source, what data type, is it mandatory or
not and the length of the column.

The sample file format will be:

Now using the ETL process now we loaded the data into Staging Tables. Intermediate tables will look
like below:

 All customers related to India will go to Table_India and so on.
 If the customer is shifted to another country and visits from that country then consider the
record with the latest consultant date.
 Create the process considering we are getting billions of data every day
Technical Assessment: Deliverables
1. Create table queries
2. Create the above tables with additional derived columns: age and days since last consulted >30
3. Create necessary validations.
4. If we move forward with an interview we would like to see the demonstration
